**🚀 RoadCare – Smart Civic & Vehicle Tracking Platform**

RoadCare is a community-driven web application built with React, JavaScript, and Firebase that empowers citizens to actively participate in maintaining urban infrastructure. The platform has three roles:

Users (Citizens): Report potholes, garbage accumulation, or infrastructure issues by uploading photos with automatic GPS location. They can also donate small amounts to support local fixers and upvote issues for prioritization.

Fixers (Volunteers/Contractors): Accept reported issues in their area, resolve them, and upload proof of completion. Their movement and task progress can be tracked in real time using GPS.

Admin (Authorities/Moderators): Validate reports, monitor municipal fleets like garbage trucks or repair vehicles, assign tasks, and ensure accountability.

In addition to issue reporting, RoadCare includes a GPS Vehicle Tracking wing that allows real-time monitoring of vehicles such as garbage trucks, school buses, and repair vans. This increases transparency and efficiency, ensuring citizens know when services will reach their area and building trust in the process.

**Core features include:**
📍 Real-time issue reporting with photos & GPS.
🗺️ Interactive map with live vehicles and issues.
🔔 Notifications for updates on reported issues.
💸 Simple donation system to reward fixers.
📡 GPS tracking for municipal vehicles and fixers.
🏆 Gamification with fixer leaderboards and community voting.

By combining crowdsourced issue reporting with IoT-powered vehicle tracking, RoadCare provides a scalable solution for smarter, cleaner, and safer cities.
