# RoadCare
RoadCare is a React + Firebase platform for smarter cities, where citizens report potholes or garbage with GPS and photos, fixers resolve issues, and admins validate. A GPS vehicle tracking wing adds transparency by monitoring municipal fleets and fixers in real time, ensuring accountability and community trust.
